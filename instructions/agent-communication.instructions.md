# Agent Communication Protocol

## Clarification First

When a task is ambiguous or underspecified, ask **one focused clarifying question** before proceeding. Do not guess at requirements — a wrong assumption wastes more time than a question.

- **User-invocable agents**: Use the `ask` tool to present structured questions with selectable options when choices are finite. Reserve free-text questions for open-ended clarification only.
- **Hidden agents** (`user-invocable: false`): You do NOT have the `ask` tool. See "Clarification Escalation" below.

## Clarification Escalation

Hidden agents cannot prompt the user directly. When a hidden agent encounters **blocking ambiguity** that it cannot resolve from context, codebase inspection, or reasonable defaults:

1. **Return to your parent** via `handoffs` — do not stall or guess blindly.
2. **Include in your handoff**:
   - What you were trying to do
   - The specific question that needs a user answer
   - What you will do with each possible answer (so the parent can present options)
3. **The parent agent** uses `ask` to get the user's answer, then re-delegates with the answer included in context.

**Prefer defaults over escalation.** If you can make a reasonable choice and note the assumption (e.g., "Assumed REST over GraphQL — change if needed"), do that instead of interrupting the user. Only escalate for decisions that would be costly to reverse: data model choices, public API contracts, technology selections, or scope questions.

## Context Window Awareness

- User stories and tasks must be scoped to fit within a single agent's context window.
- When breaking down work, each unit should be completable without requiring the full project context.
- If a task is too large, break it into sequential subtasks and specify the handoff points.

## Handoff Protocol

When delegating to another agent or handing off results:

1. **State the goal** — What needs to be accomplished.
2. **Provide context** — Relevant files, decisions, and constraints.
3. **Specify output** — What the receiving agent should produce.
4. **Note dependencies** — What must happen before or after this task.

## Chain of Command

- `@cto` routes to division leads only — never directly to specialists.
- `@principal-engineer` routes to engineering specialists (backend, frontend, database, devops, mobile, dotnet, ml, data-scientist, qa).
- Specialists do not delegate to other specialists — they escalate to `@principal-engineer` if cross-domain work is needed.

## QA Access

`@qa-engineer` can be invoked by any agent that needs tests written, test suites run, or test quality reviewed. QA is a shared service, not restricted to one chain.
