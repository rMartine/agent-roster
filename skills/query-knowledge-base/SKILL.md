# Query Knowledge Base

Search the team's institutional knowledge for relevant error patterns, anti-patterns, lessons learned, and best practices.

## When to Use

- Before starting implementation in a domain with known pitfalls
- When encountering an error or unexpected behavior
- During code review to check for known anti-patterns
- After a bug fix to see if the pattern is already cataloged

## Procedure

### 1. Check Local Cache First

Look in `project_docs/knowledge/` for locally cached entries relevant to the query. These are curated entries specific to the current project.

```
project_docs/knowledge/
  *.md                    # Knowledge entries in markdown format
```

Search by keywords, domain tags, and error messages.

### 2. Query the Knowledge Repository (if available)

If the Docker-based PostgreSQL knowledge repository is running, query it for broader cross-project patterns.

Connect to the knowledge database:
- Host: `localhost`
- Port: `5433` (default for knowledge repo, avoids conflict with project DB)
- Database: `knowledge`
- Table: `entries`

Example queries:
```sql
-- Search by domain
SELECT * FROM entries WHERE 'backend' = ANY(affected_domains) ORDER BY severity, updated DESC;

-- Search by keywords (full-text)
SELECT * FROM entries WHERE to_tsvector('english', title || ' ' || description) @@ plainto_tsquery('english', 'your search terms');

-- Search by error type
SELECT * FROM entries WHERE type = 'error-pattern' AND tags @> ARRAY['connection-pool'];
```

### 3. Return Results

For each matching entry, return:
- **Title** and **severity**
- **Description** of the issue
- **Prevention** steps
- **Examples** with code snippets if available

If no matches found, state that clearly — do not fabricate entries.

## Entry Format Reference

Knowledge entries follow this structure:
- `type`: error-pattern | anti-pattern | lesson-learned | best-practice
- `severity`: critical | high | medium | low
- `affected_domains`: backend, frontend, infrastructure, database, security, ml
- `tags`: searchable keywords
- `prevention`: how to avoid the issue
- `detection`: how to spot it early
